🎃 PUMPKINFEST 2025 - Thursday Oct 30th! 🎃

Hey everyone! Time for my *totally annual* pumpkin party! (And by annual, I mean whenever I manage to align the stars, planets, and my own chaos across time and SPACE! 😅)

October is SERIOUS pumpkin business, and this year we're celebrating all things orange and gourd-y! Plus, BONUS EXCITEMENT - both IXI and Natalie will be in town!! 🙌

Here's the deal:
🎃 Bring a pumpkin to carve!
🔪 Carving tools range from tiny plastic scrapers to "the most dangerous power tools we're legally allowed to use" 😉
🥧 Potluck style - bring pumpkin pie, pumpkin beer, cider, or whatever weird pumpkin concoction you can find
📸 We'll document the art/destruction and crown a winner!
🛡️ Plastic sheeting will protect us from the carnage

Keeping it intimate as usual - you can probably bring a friend, but not several. Ask first!

Who's in? React with a 🎃 if you're coming!
