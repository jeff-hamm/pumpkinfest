!!!! I love Halloween and have been looking forward to it this year so much since we couldn't do anything last year and now we have FRIENDS and we're TOGETHER. Let's do fun things pleeeeeeaaaasssseee
Briana
We do want to have our pumpkin carving party over here, but that's more of a daytime thing (it could certainly turn into a nighttime party as well), so that could be either  Saturday October 23rd, Sunday Oct. 24th, or Sat. Oct. 30th/Sun Oct. 31st Let us know what day works best for y'all. 

I'm going to look up the Zombie Ball thing now 😮
Mikaela
Yes!! Pumpkin carving! 🤩🎃

Bex

Bex

I've sucked at planning this year because Room Service has taken over all of our lives, but we're having a pumpkin carving party over here tomorrow night! I didn't make a FB event . . . I'm doing great 👍

It'll be our 3rd and final carving party on this side of the Sac, so despite the lack of preparation, I am really excited for it! Please B.Y.O.Pumpkin! 🎃

Lady MacBex
yay! i made a pumpkin bread AND pumpkin oatmeal cookies AND got a pumpkin cheesecake (but not a pumpkin pie so DEF get that!) AND got two kinds of cheese from TJ's the caramelized onion one we love and a fancy triple cream brie... AND of course a really fab foccacia is on its way!
Lady MacBex
@Mikaela Holmes that all sounds soooooo yummy!

I want to make my pumpkin mousse thing - I need to pick up a can of pumpkin, a couple tubs of cool whip, and some whole milk. If anyone has or can snag the canned pumpkin - a lot of times that is out of stock and I can't get to the store until later today 🙏
Lady MacBex
damn they had it at TJs last night 🙁
Mikaela
I can look at costco, but I imagine you don't want... like 12 of them 😅
Whowhat?
I’m headed to TJs here in a bit I can pick one up. Just one? Also what time are these shenanigans taking place? Also is anyone dressing up, besides Soup and I ?
Lady MacBex
oh.. lol.. im bringing all my stuff for costuming down again so yup.. ill dress up with ya and try out 'looks'
Mikaela
Ohh, I forgot about dressing up 😅
Metal
I would LOVE for folks to dress up!
Metal
Re: TJs - thank you!! Yes - 1 can pumpkin, please, and 1 tub of cool whip-equivalent (it has to be the tub kind for this particular recipe)
OH - and I forgot to ask Becky last night, but if you see a can of their coconut whipped cream, could you snag that too? Thank you SO SO much!
Whowhat?
I’m heading there now. I’ll let you know.

Also please feel welcome and encouraged to come to pumpkin carving night in costume! I’m super into my Princess Caroline costume but not sure if it’s gonna be right for Zombie Ball? And I want to see @Mikaela in some sick-ass makeup!

oh! Also, we've got to start thinking about collecting pumpkins for pumpkin fest. Anyone wanna see if we can find a pumpkin patch this weekend?


I could be into that! I love a pumpkin patch 🤩. I know there is one by Carlsbad with a corn maze etc, but if @Becky Bourgeois and @Len Bourgeois are not around this weekend, maybe we could do it after work next week instead?


Also Re: Pumpkin Patches - based on my very cursory research, it still looks like the Carlsbad one (https://www.carlsbadstrawberrycompany.com/pumpkin) in the most farm/least carnival and is open until 7pm on weekdays (but the maize maze turns into a haunted maze on Weekends! 😱😱), however there are definitely closer ones such as: https://www.pumpkinstation.com/pumpkin-stations/del-mar-pumpkin-station/.



Briana replied to Mikaela
Yes! We want to go to PB Pumpkin Patch! And then afterwards folks could drop their pumpkins off over here and we could watch a pumpkin/Halloween movie or something?


I'll bring home baked bread and, um, something else? I want to toast pumkin seeds - @Briana, @Jeff do y'all have baking sheets and aluminum foil I could use?
Marina
I'm inviting Ashley and another friend - Tegan - if that's still okay.
Bex
yes... pumpkin seeds!!!!
Mikaela
Mulled cider, baked brie with some accouterments. Would also be happy to make something more substantial like  a salad or a pasta or something depending on what else people are bringing.
Briana replied to Marina
of course pumpkins seeds - all are invited to try their own spice mix/flavorings if you have them. we have 2 baking sheets

Jumper invited Ashley, feel free to invite Tegan (I'm assuming vaccination status here). they might want to bring their own pumpkin?
Briana
pumpkin beer and other pumpkin flavored drinks would be amaze if folks wanted to bring those!!
