ðŸŽƒ PUMPKINFEST 2025: The *Annual* Celebration That Defies Time and Space! ðŸŽƒ

Thursday, October 30th, 2025

I love pumpkins. And October is serious pumpkin business. This year marks the return of my *totally annual* pumpkin party! (By "annual" I mean whenever the cosmic forces align and I actually manage to pull this together across the dimensions of time and SPACE! ðŸ˜„)

SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT: Both IXI and Natalie will be in town for this one!! ðŸŒŸ

This is a celebration of all things pumpkin -- from pumpkin beer to pumpkin pie to pumpkin spice... everything you can imagine!

ðŸŽƒ THE PLAN:
â€¢ Bring a pumpkin to carve!
â€¢ We'll set up carving stations with plastic sheeting for maximum mess potential
â€¢ Tools range from little plastic scrapers to the most dangerous power tools we're legally allowed to use ðŸ˜‰
â€¢ Photo documentation of all artistic achievements and beautiful destruction
â€¢ Crown a winner of the great pumpkin competition!

ðŸ¥§ POTLUCK STYLE:
Bring pumpkin pie, pumpkin beer, cider, or whatever wonderfully weird pumpkin formulation you can find! We could definitely use more pumpkin-carving implements too ðŸ™‚

ðŸ‘¥ INTIMATE GATHERING:
Keeping this cozy - you're welcome to bring a friend, but not several. Please ask first!

Ready to get your gourd on? Let me know if you're coming! ðŸŽƒâœ¨
