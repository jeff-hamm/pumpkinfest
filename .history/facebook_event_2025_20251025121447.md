# 🎃 PUMPKINFEST 2025: The Annual Celebration! 🎃

**Thursday, October 30th, 2025**

I love pumpkins. And October is serious pumpkin business. This year marks the return of my annual pumpkin party! 🎃

**SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT:** Both IXI and Natalie will be in town for this one!! 🌟

This is a celebration of all things pumpkin -- from pumpkin beer to pumpkin pie to pumpkin spice... everything you can imagine!

## 🎃 THE PLAN:
- Bring a pumpkin to carve!
- We'll set up carving stations with plastic sheeting for maximum mess potential
- Tools range from little plastic scrapers to the most dangerous power tools we're legally allowed to use 😉
- Photo documentation of all artistic achievements and beautiful destruction
- Crown a winner of the great pumpkin competition!

## 🥧 POTLUCK STYLE:
Bring pumpkin pie, pumpkin beer, cider, or whatever wonderfully weird pumpkin formulation you can find! We could definitely use more pumpkin-carving implements too 🙂

## 👥 INTIMATE GATHERING:
Keeping this cozy - you're welcome to bring a friend, but not several. Please ask first!

Ready to get your gourd on? Let me know if you're coming! 🎃✨
