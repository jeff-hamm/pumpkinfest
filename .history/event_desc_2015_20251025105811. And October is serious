eI love pumpkins. And October is serious pumpkin business. Back in Boston, I used to throw a pumpkin-based party in my apartment. This year, we're doing it in SPACE!
This is a celebration of all things pumpkin -- from pumpkin beer to pumpkin pie to pumpkin spice condoms.
Bring a pumpkin! We'll put down a bit of plastic sheeting, and setup some pumpkin carving stations. Carving tools will range from the little-plastic-scrapey things all the way up to the most dangerous power tools we're allowed use ðŸ˜‰. We'll take some photos of the art/destruction and crown a winner!
This'll be potluck style: bring pumpkin pie, pumpkin beer, cider, or whatever weirdo pumpkin formulation you can find.
We could definitely use more pumpkin-carving implements as well ðŸ™‚
We're keeping this one intimate, so, you're probably welcome to bring a friend, but not several. Ask first! See less
