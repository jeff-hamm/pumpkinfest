Hey space cadets!

Deets: A celebration of all things pumpkin -- from pumpkin beer to pumpkin pie to pumpkin spice condoms.

Bring a pumpkin! We'll put down a bit of plastic sheeting, and setup some pumpkin carving stations. 
With a gentle encouragement towards power tools (Bring your dremel! Bring your reciprocating saw!) Bring your angl grinder, we'll have plenty of 
Carving tools will range from the little-plastic-scrapey. 

A potluck: Bring pumpkin beer (cider grudgingly accepted also), Pumpkin pie, or any weirdo formulation of pumpkins you might find out in the world.

Date: Thursday, Oct 30th
